# Lizard Journey: A 2D Adventure Game

## What Problem Does This Solve?
Lizard Journey is a 2D adventure game built with the LÃ–VE framework (Love2D) that provides an entertaining gaming experience while demonstrating game development principles in Lua. It offers players a chance to control a lizard character through various challenges and environments.

## Who Is This For?
- Casual gamers looking for a 2D adventure experience
- Lua developers interested in game development with LÃ–VE
- Students learning game programming concepts
- Anyone interested in exploring open-source game development

## Current Implementation Status
- âœ… Basic character movement and controls
- âœ… Game world rendering
- âœ… Simple collision detection
- ðŸš§ Level design and progression
- ðŸš§ Enemy AI and interactions
- ðŸ“‹ Advanced game mechanics
- ðŸ“‹ Story elements and cutscenes

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- [LÃ–VE](https://love2d.org/) framework (version 11.x recommended)
- Basic understanding of Lua programming (for developers)

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/nczempin/lizard-journey.git
   cd lizard-journey
   ```

2. Install LÃ–VE if you don't have it already:
   - Windows: Download from [love2d.org](https://love2d.org/)
   - macOS: `brew install love`
   - Linux: `sudo apt install love` or equivalent for your distribution

### Running the Game
1. Using LÃ–VE directly:
   ```
   love love2d/

3. Alternatively, visit the online version at: http://nczempin.github.io/lizard-journey/

## Project Scope

### What This IS
- A 2D adventure game featuring a lizard protagonist
- A demonstration of LÃ–VE/Lua game development techniques
- An open-source game project for learning and entertainment

### What This IS NOT
- Not a commercial-grade game with extensive features
- Not optimized for all platforms and screen sizes
- Not a complete game engine or framework

## Repository Structure
- `love2d/` - Main game directory for the LÃ–VE framework
  - `main.lua` - Entry point for the LÃ–VE framework
  - `conf.lua` - Configuration settings for the game
  - `player.lua` - Player character implementation
  - `level.lua` - Level design and management
  - `assets/` - Game assets (images, sounds, etc.)

## Controls
- Arrow keys: Move the lizard character
- Space: Jump/Action
- Escape: Pause/Menu

## Development Status
This is an experimental game project in active development. Contributions and feedback are welcome.
